// JS = ASCII code code use garxa if there is any confusion use ascii chart so if there is capital letter and small letter in comparison operator
// then use small letter as greater in interviews

// ? comparison operators are == , === , !=, !== , <,> , <=, >=;

//? == checks only value indifferent of datatype ;
//? === checks value as well as datatypes;


//? comparison operator gives return value in boolean either true or false


let x= "true";
let y= true;

console.log(x==y);
console.log(x===y);

console.log(x !== y);
console.log(x != y);
